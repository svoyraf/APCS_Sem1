            Basics of the game:
            - Given a set of words, the player must memorize the colors
            - After a 5 second delay, the player must type in each color one at a time on separate lines
            - At any point, if they type in an incorrect color, the game ends. The game will print out the correct colors.
            - If they get them all right, the game will continue and add one more word to the series.
            - The series changes every round.

                    - Check all words against the generated list of words
                    - ALL words should be taken in, THEN you can tell the user if they lost
                    - This means checking and keeping track of if they lost or not
                6. Once all inputs are taken in 
                    - Tell the user if they lost or won
                    - If they lost, print out the correct series of colors and end the game
                    - If they won, start a new round with one more word (start back at step 1)
